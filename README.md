<h1> Matrix Determinant Calculation </h1>

<p> This project was developed in Python and provides two methods for computing the determinant of a matrix: the Laplace method and the Gauss method. It uses the NumPy and Matplotlib modules for matrix manipulation and plotting, respectively. It also includes a performance comparison of these two methods to determine their relative efficiency. </p>

<h2> Getting Started </h2>
<p> To use this project, simply download or clone the repository and run the <strong>main.py</strong> script. This script will prompt you to enter the size of the matrix and the elements of the matrix. It will then compute the determinant of the matrix using both the Laplace method and the Gauss method, and output the results and timing information. </p>

<h2> Performance Comparison </h2>
<p> In addition to the matrix determinant calculation, this project also includes a performance comparison of the Laplace method, the Gauss method and the LU factorization method. The <strong>performance_comparison.py</strong> script can be run to generate a plot of the time taken to compute the determinant of matrices of increasing size using the three methods. This plot can be used to compare the efficiency of the three methods and determine which is faster for larger matrices. </p>
